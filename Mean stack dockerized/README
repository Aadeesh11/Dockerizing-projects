Demo app for blog post: Setup Meanstack App With Docker
Meanstack app can be pulled from docker: chld/mean-app:1.0.
Run project with 'docker-compose up'
The app uses my waf implementation with ModSecurity core rule set chld/waf:1.0, which requires that the container are called app and is running on port 8080.
